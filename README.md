# Python_CDC_Project

## Created an in-depth notebook project by coding and visualizing with Python to help provide valuable insights to the CDC. 

Employing t-tests, Pearson correlation tests, and the computation of confidence intervals, I conducted analyses to assess means, correlations, and distinctions across various groups.

To facilitate the examination of data distributions and gain insights into disparities and trends among different groups, I harnessed histogram visualizations and summarized statistics.
These groups included distinct drug types and gender categories.

The code for these analyses was crafted using Python, with the utilization of essential programming libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

I explained how to get the data frame in the notebook along with very valuable comments for each line of code I used!!
